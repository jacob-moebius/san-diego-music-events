# san-diego-music-events
A simple Android app that displays a list of music events in the San Diego area pre-COVID-19 from a JSON file. The user can tap a list item on the main activity to see more detailed information on the chosen artist. The user can add/remove tasks and check a box for each task if completed. A ListAdapter is used to populate the list of tasks in a ListView. This app demonstrates passing data and transitioning between multiple activities.
